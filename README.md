# Efficient-Modular-Adder-Designs-Based-on-Thermometer-and-One-Hot-Coding
Residue number systems (RNSs) are efficient
alternatives to positional number systems, providing fast and
power-efficient computational systems. The key feature of the
RNS benefitting modern embedded systems and the Internet-of-
Thing (IoT) edge devices is its energy efficiency.Modular addition
is the most important and frequent operation applied on the
components of RNS, including arithmetic units in the channels
as well as forward and reverse converters. The small and medium
dynamic range requirements of low-power embedded and edge
devices make the usage of the thermometer coding (TC) and onehot
coding (OHC) viable, reducing the power consumption and
improving the energy efficiency of modulo addition in comparison
to regular binary representations. Based on these techniques,
this paper presents two new energy-efficient modular adders,
which, due to the carry-free internal computations, are also
highly performing. The proposed modular adders based on the
TC and OHC result in average improvements of 38% and 34.5%
for the delay, 27% and 14.5% for the circuit area, 29.5% and
6.3% for energy consumption, and about 54.9% and 44.2% for
the area-delay product (ADP), respectively, in comparison with
the related state of the art.
